# share edit

This app is an experiment using Chrome's [Share Target Level 2](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6124071381106688) implementation, allowing Progressive Web Apps to appear in the share sheet and accept images. If you [install this app](https://catdad-experiments.github.io/share-edit/) using the "Add to home screen" prompt, it will add an "Edit" option to your share sheet, allowing you to do some basic image editing in a web app!

I got tired of having each app always save a copy of my image any time edit an image. Taking a simple screenshot for a one-off share can result in 3 or 4 images being saved and you have to then go delete in order to clear the clutter. And solving this problem with a small web application is just cool! With newer version of Android (and Chrome 76+), you can now take a screenshot by summoning assistant and selecitng "Share screenshot", crop and markup in this app, and share it out, all without ever saving an image. Neat!
